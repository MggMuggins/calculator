# Calculator
A simple calculator in C++ for school. Putting this up here since I'm working with peers.

##Code::Blocks
This is a Code::Blocks project, so you'll have to use that IDE. I guess I coud just strip out the Code::Blocks files and leave the bare source, but it's easier for everyone this way. I may do that later.
